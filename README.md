    “810 Women approximately, die everyday from preventable causes         
             that remain undiagnosed"

     in the world ”-India Today
Many times women’s health conditions go undiagnosed and most drug trials do not include female test subjects. Depression and anxiety exhibit more frequently among female patients. She also neglects her fitness. 
Most women neglect or feel hesitant to visit Gynecologist and this reluctance results in hazardous results.
